# ðŸ›  MySQL Brute-Force & Default Credentials Exploit

# Objective
Gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database service running on Metasploitable2 by brute-forcing or trying default credentials.

---

#  Service Overview

- **Service**: MySQL
- **Port**: 3306/tcp
- **Version**: MySQL 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5 (based on nmap detection)
- **Nmap Output Snippet**: 3306/tcp open mysql MySQL 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5


---

# Tools Used

- `hydra`: for brute-force attacks
- `mysql` CLI client: for direct login attempts

---

# Brute-Force Command

We initially attempted to brute-force credentials using `hydra`:

hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.6.3 mysql

Breakdown:
-L users.txt: list of potential usernames

-P rockyou.txt: wordlist of passwords

192.168.6.3: target IP

mysql: target service module

Note: Hydra can be slow against MySQL due to handshake delays and server-side throttling. It's more efficient to first try known default credentials.

# Successful Access

After trying default credentials manually, we successfully accessed MySQL using:

mysql -u root -p -h 192.168.6.3 --skip-ssl

-username : root
-password : 

We bypassed the TLS/SSL error by disabling SSL with --skip-ssl, as the legacy MySQL server doesn't support modern encryption.

# Post-Exploitation Possibilities

Once logged in, an attacker could:

Enumerate users: SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

Read sensitive data from databases

Create new users with admin privileges

Inject UDF payloads for privilege escalation or reverse shells
