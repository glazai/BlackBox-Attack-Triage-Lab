# Telnet Access – Metasploitable2

# Summary

This document outlines the successful exploitation of the Telnet service running on the Metasploitable2 machine. The target was accessible via port 23 using default credentials, resulting in a direct shell access.

---

# Target Information

- **Target IP**: 192.168.6.3  
- **Port**: 23 (Telnet)  
- **Service**: Telnet  
- **OS**: Ubuntu (Metasploitable2)  

---

# Tools Used

- `telnet` (default Kali package)

---

# Exploitation Steps

1. **Port Discovery**
   - Confirmed Telnet was running on port 23 using Nmap:
     ```bash
     nmap -sV -p 23 192.168.6.3
     ```

2. **Telnet Connection**
   - Connected to the Telnet service:
     ```bash
     telnet 192.168.6.3
     ```

3. **Login Credentials**
   - Successfully logged in using **default credentials**:
     - **Username**: `msfadmin`
     - **Password**: `msfadmin`

4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Full shell access was granted immediately after authentication.
   - Verified user privileges and confirmed interaction with the remote file system:
     ```bash
     whoami
     uname -a
     ```

# Notes

- No brute-force was necessary as default credentials worked immediately.
- Telnet is an insecure protocol that transmits credentials in plaintext, making it vulnerable to sniffing attacks.
