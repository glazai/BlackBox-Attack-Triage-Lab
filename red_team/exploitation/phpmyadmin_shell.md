# Exploitation Attempt: phpMyAdmin Login

## Objective

Access the phpMyAdmin web interface on the target host using default or weak credentials in order to gain SQL access and potentially write a web shell to the server.

---

## Target

- **URL**: http://192.168.6.3/phpMyAdmin/
- **Service**: Apache 2.2.8 + phpMyAdmin

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Navigated to Login Interface
Visited: `http://192.168.6.3/phpMyAdmin/`  
Page loaded successfully

### 2. Attempted Common Credential Pairs:

| Username | Password | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `root`   | `root`   |  Access denied |
| `root`   | *(blank)*|  Access denied |
| `admin`  | `admin`  |  Access denied |
| `mysql`  | `mysql`  |  #1045 Access Denied |
| `pma`    | `pmapass`|  Access denied |

Message received:

#1045 - Access denied for user 'mysql'@'localhost' (using password: YES)


### 3. Notes:
- phpMyAdmin interface is **publicly accessible** with **no CAPTCHA or rate-limiting**
- Exposed admin interfaces increase attack surface significantly
- No login success achieved using common default combinations

---

##  Outcome

This attack path was **not successful**, but its exposure is still a critical finding. Further actions could include brute-force, exploiting other services for credential reuse, or SQLi via other PHP apps.
