# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Initial Access / Valid Accounts, T1078.001, Valid Accounts: Default Accounts, Attackers leveraged a weak/default VNC password (password) to gain unauthorized access.

Command and Control, T1021.001, Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol, Although RDP is not used, VNC fits the same category of remote desktop access. Adversaries used VNC to establish GUI-based control over the system.

Discovery, T1016, System Network Configuration Discovery, After access, attackers may explore the environment using the graphical interface, including network configs and system details.
